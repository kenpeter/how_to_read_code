# How to read code with Feynman, Pomodoro, and Mind map 

I am going to pick a very simple nodejs tutorial which contains lots of text and a bit of code. This illustrates how to use Feynman technique and Pomodoro to read the code. I use mind map to take note of the nodejs tutorial. It helps me to understand better.

[Here is the nodejs tutorial we are going to read](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/ultra-fast-applications-using-node-js/creating-your-first-app-with-node-js)

[Here is the note for the combined techniques](https://atlas.mindmup.com/2017/11/6c30de00c1b611e7a71cf93806058463/how_to_read_code_with_feynman_and_other_techniques/index.html)
